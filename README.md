# Bike Parts Inventory Record System

The Bike Parts Inventory System is a C# (C Sharp) based desktop application created by using .NET MAUI Blazor. This system helps a bike service centre to manage their stock/inventory records. Making a scenario as an example: There's a bike service centre that allows staff to get or take items out from the inventory only between 9am to 4pm, 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). Staffs are allowed to only withdraw tools or other items from inventory after being approved by an admin. However, the system allows you to add items to inventory at any time.
